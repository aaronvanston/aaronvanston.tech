A few days ago I came across a website that changed my Chromeâ€™s address bar a different colour, this feature I competently missed and was not aware of. After a some digging around I found its a new feature in Chrome 39 on Android lollipop+ called `theme-color`.

The theme color is set within a meta tag within the head, simply fill the content with a color and youâ€™re all set!

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#db5945">
```

I then wanted to test if this could be updated and if so how fast. Results are pretty good, I hooked it up to a button that on click will generate a random color apply that to `theme-color` and also the button border. Results:

Again make sure when testing its on an Android Lollipop+ with at least Chrome 39. ðŸ™‚
